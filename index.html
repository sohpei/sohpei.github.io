            <p>I'm really interested in storytelling! The stories that I've told/been told/etc. have shaped a whole lot of who I am today, and I love thinking and learning more about this.</p>
            <p> Right now, I'm pursuing an M.A. in Digital Humanities at McGill University where I look at how stories can be studied computationally.</p>
    <p>Currently, I'm interested in:
        <ul>
            <li>Experimenting with using LLMs (or "AI", if you want to call it that) for large-scale literary analyis/cultural studies</li>
            <li>Investigating the relationship between emotion and language</li>
            <li>Thinking about ✨vibes✨ a lot</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Before starting at McGill, I studied math alongside the arts/humanities at Western University. I'm really grateful that I've been able to dabble a slight amount all over the place throughout my life.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for learning about me - I'd be happy to learn about you too! Always happy to chat about any of the above: <b>"sophie(dot)wu(at)mail(dot)mcgill(dot)ca"!</b></p>
